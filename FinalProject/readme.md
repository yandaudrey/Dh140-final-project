# Networking analysis of Tower Theatre and Los Angeles Theatre 
### Introduction
My project focuses on newspaper articles in <em>The Los Angeles News</em> published between 1927â€“1931 surrounding Tower Theatre and Los Angeles Theatre in downtown LA. 
Both Tower Theatre and Los Angeles Theatre were built by legendary architect S. Charles Lee in 1927 and 1931, respectively.
I would like to explore a network of the architect, theater owners, investors, and other technicians to understand how the network influenced the completion of these two buildings. 

### Justification 
My project is in progress. It already contained blueprint annotations and a portion of demonstration of 3D modeling. 
But there are a shortage of qualitative analyses, such as text analysis and networking analysis to make this project more complete. 
If I can integrate networking analysis into this project, it will help readers understand how the completion of these two buildings involved in fields of cinema, business, architecture, and science.  
The stake of this project is a limitation of archival research. 
Due to the limited  time, I can only collect data from <em>The Los Angeles News</em>. 
However, there are still a lot of newspaper articles surrounding these two buildings that I am not able to explore this quarter. 

### Data source 
Newspaper articles published in <em>The Los Angeles News</em> between 1927 to 1931. 
Here is the [datasource](https://ucla.box.com/s/64a3z1vryea3252rqhrm4g26zei9av48) that I exported from my Zotero collection. 
This CSV file only listed article titles that I am going to analyze. 
In order to begin the networking analysis, I have to manually calculate frequency of figures appeared in the articles and create another dataset for python. 

### Scope 
I guess I can create an interactive image displaying the network between people involving in these two buildings, and then I can integrate article contents into the network to produce some narratives. 

### Expected results 
Currently, I can only imagine that I will get a network image to domonstrate people's relationships. But I hope eventually I can also find a way to conduct text analysis in terms of article contents.
